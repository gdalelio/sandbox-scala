     * engine cannot determine by the Object's inheritance tree if it
     * satisfies required structure (like it would with Traits or
     * abstract classes). The Runtime engine must use a slightly more
     * costly Reflection introspection. This feature is deemed optional
     * in Scala but can be turned on by the following import statement */

     * Instead of tying an Object's structure to a named type such as a Trait
     * or abstract class Scala allows to define a more loosely structure known
     * as a structural type. The following declaration describes the members
     * an expected type must have in order to be used by the object as parameter.
     * It then assigns it to an internal name. Every object passed to the Object's
     * methods must adhere to the structure defined by the internal type. */

    /* Structural Type describing a function.
     * The above used structural type does lift the dependency on a named type by
     * other objects but it passes that dependency down to the method. It requires
     * all objects to implement a specific method. This dependency can also be
     * removed by declaring a structural type that describes a function rather than
     * an object. The following structural type definition requires that a passed
     * function follows a certain signature but abstracts the function's name.
     * This way allows us to implement methods with arbitrary names to be registered
     * with this object. */
